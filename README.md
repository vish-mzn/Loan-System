# üè¶ Loan Application Management API

This is a Spring Boot-based RESTful application developed for managing loan applications, built as part of a Java backend assessment.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Submit and update loan applications
- Retrieve loan records with pagination
- Validate applicants by credit score (mock external API)
- Logs all HTTP requests and responses
- Data initialization using `data.sql`
- No Lombok ‚Äì constructor-based injection
- Uses `WebClient` for external API calls
- Enum mapping for loan status (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`)

## üß± Architecture & Design Patterns

| Concept                     | Implementation |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Architecture**           | Layered (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository) |
| **Dependency Injection**   | Constructor-based injection (manual, no Lombok) |
| **Persistence**            | Spring Data JPA |
| **External API Call**      | `WebClient` (non-blocking, clean abstraction) |
| **DTO Usage**              | Used to separate domain and API layers |
| **Enum Mapping**           | JPA Enum (`@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)`) |
| **Filter**                 | Custom Servlet Filter for request/response logging |
| **Logging**                | SLF4J with log file at `C:/loan-sytem-logs/loan-app.log` |
| **Database Initialization**| Via `data.sql` on app start |

## Setup Instructions (For Developers)

‚úÖ 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/vish-mzn/Loan-System.git

cd Loan-System


‚úÖ 2. Start MySQL (using Docker)

docker run --name mysql8 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d mysql:8

‚úÖ 3. Build and Run

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

## üåê External Properties

### ‚úÖ Mock External Credit Score API (Mockoon)

To simulate the third-party credit score API during local development, this project uses [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/), a lightweight mock server.

Make sure to start the mock server using Mockoon with the expected endpoint running on port `9000`.

**Property to set in `application.properties`:**

third.party.url=http://localhost:9000/api/mockcredit

## üì¨ Postman Collection

A Postman collection is provided to help developers quickly test and explore the Loan Application Management APIs.

üìÅ **Location**:  
`postman-collection/LoanSystem.postman_collection.json`

### üîß How to Use

1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import**
3. Select the file:  
   `postman-collection/LoanSystem.postman_collection.json`
4. Set environment variables if needed (e.g., `baseUrl = http://localhost:9090`)
5. Run requests such as:
   - `POST /api/loans`
   - `GET /api/loans`
   - `PUT /api/loans/{id}` (requires Basic Auth with role `ADMIN`)

This collection includes authentication headers and request bodies to help you get started immediately.
